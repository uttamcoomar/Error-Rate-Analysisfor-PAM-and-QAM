# Error-Rate-Analysisfor-PAM-and-QAM
These MATLAB codes generate plots for error rate analysis for PAM and QAM communication systems

Here, error_rate_analysis.m is the main file, and the other four .m files are dependencies, that define the functions needed by the main file.
Upon execution error_rate_analysis presents a small window, that allows user to enter his choices for presenting the error rate nalysis.
